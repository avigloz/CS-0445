# CS-0445 Files

This repository contains all files (besides .class files, which are essentially clutter) from assignments in my CS 0445 class, which I took in Spring 2019 at the University of Pittsburgh.

For some of my thoughts on a couple of these assignments, see my Pitt site: http://pitt.edu/~abg41

My professor was Timothy Hoffman.

If you find this repo useful, please leave it a star. 

## *PLEASE NOTE:*

I **DO NOT** endorse plagiarism. If you submit my code exactly as is, it is likely you will be caught.
You may use this code solely for **INSPIRATION** and **GUIDANCE** and nothing more.

Do your own work, and that way you'll learn. Otherwise, drop the class and change your major to something other than CS.
